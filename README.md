## What I did

In this project, I work with html, css and sass to create this sport app page. This site is talking about sports. This is all built with html, css and sass. Instead of working with css to style this page, I used sass and compile it into css by installing node modules. To do that you need to open a terminal from your vs code or from the powershell, those are all good.

```bash
# Install node-modules
$ npm install node-modules

# Remove the test attribute from the script attribute in package.json file, and replace it with something like:
$ css: node-sass scss/index.scss -o webroot/css,
$ css:watch: npm run css && node-sass scss -w -o webroot/css

# Put quote arround css like "css": "node-sass scss/index.scss -o webroot/css" and the same with "css:watch".

# Compile it into css
$ npm run css:watch
```
